     <h1> Professional Resume </h1>
     <p>
       I graduated in 2018 as an Electronics Technician from Colégio Técnico da UFMG. To obtain my diploma, I took a<br>
       technical internship at Elevadores Otis LTDA, a reference company in the area of elevators. I worked there for 9 months and<br>
       I performed the most diverse services, from cleaning elevators to installing equipment in building works. Now<br>
       I am looking for an opportunity to work in a company that allows me to expand my knowledge in technology and<br>
       science, as well as expanding my experience in the corporate world. For the future, I passed the entrance exam at UFMG<br>
       to take a bachelor's degree in Physics and I intend to specialize more and more and continue working with science.<br>
